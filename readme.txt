what im trying to do is, set up my buildRow function where it not only creates the row /stores data in my visual database but it also delets the username and password combination from my database by deleting it from local storage, if i put that same username and password combination in my input fields!
im doing that by making an if statment that says if if my username is included in the array that holds the list of all my usernames and the password is inluded in the array that holds all of my passwords remove that from localstorage which will delete it from the visual dataBase. for now im just trying to get a simple console log.
